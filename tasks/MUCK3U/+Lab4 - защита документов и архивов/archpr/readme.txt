= Overview =

ARCHPR is a program to recover lost or forgotten passwords to archives (compressed files) of the following types:

- ZIP/PKZip/WinZIP (all versions except PKZip 5.x)
- ACE/WinACE (1.x)
- ARJ/WinARJ
- RAR/WinRAR

At the moment, there is no known method to extract the password from such compressed files, so the only available methods are "brute force" and dictionary attacks (for ARJ and ZIP formats, known-plaintext attack is also available).

The key features of ARCHPR are:

- The program has a convenient user interface
- The program is very fast: for ZIP, brute-force attack speed is up to 15 million passwords per second (on Pentium III)
- Guaranteed decryption (usually, within the hour) of most WinZip archives (with 5+ encrypted files) is available; it works regardless the password complexity and length
- The program can work with archives containing only one encrypted file (at about the same speed)
- Self-extracting archives are supported
- The program is customizable: you can set the password length (or length range), the character set to be used to generate the passwords, and a lot of other options
- You can select the custom character set for brute-force attack (non-English characters are supported)
- Dictionary-based attack is available
- The "brute-force with mask" attack is available
- The maximum password length is not limited (in registered version)
- Very fast known-plaintext attack is available (for ZIP and ARJ)
- No special virtual memory requirements
- You can interrupt the program at any time, and start from the same point later
- The program can work in the background, using the CPU only when it is in idle state
