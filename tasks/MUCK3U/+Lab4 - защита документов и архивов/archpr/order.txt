
You can order fully registered version of ARCHPR at a cost of $60 (personal license) or $120 (business license). With the personal license, you can use the program for non-commercial purposes in non-business, non commercial environment. To use the program in a corporate, government or business environment, you should purchase a business license.

The fastest and easiest way is through the World Wide Web; your personal information including name, address and credit card number is being encrypted and sent directly to the credit card processor in a secure manner, so that nobody else can see it. Alternatively, you can also use the wire transfer, or purchase order, or send us a personal or company check. Phone and fax orders are accepted as well.

On payment approval (usually within a few minutes after you register online), we'll send you the registration key which will remove all limitations of the unregistered version, such as maximum password length, etc. Your registration will be valid for all future versions of ARCHPR.

If you will not get your registration key within a reasonable amount of time (three business days for credit card payments or two weeks for other payments), please notify us about that! We're very sorry for any inconvenience caused by those delays.

Important: when filling the order form, please double-check that your e-mail address is correct. If it will not, we'll be unable to send you the registration code.
