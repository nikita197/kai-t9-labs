Advanced Office XP Password Recovery (or simply AOXPPR) is a program to recover lost or forgotten passwords for the documents/files created in the following applications (all versions up to 2002/XP):

  - passwords to email accounts
- Microsoft Money
- Microsoft Backup (Windows 95/98)
- Microsoft Schedule+
- Microsoft Mail
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 3/4/5 (Content Advisor)

AOXPPR also includes the VBA 'backdoor' feature (works for all MS Office 97, Office 2000 and Office XP applications, as well as other programs which have VBA projects, such as Corel WordPerfect Office, AutoCAD etc).

The program is compatible with all international (non-English) versions of MS Office. Most passwords are being recovered (or removed) instantly. However, “password to open” in Office 97/2000/XP is encrypted with a very strong algorithm and requires time-consuming brute-force or dictionary attacks to be performed; the success/recovery rate is about 80-85%, but if the password is long (8+ characters) and complex, it cannot be recovered at all (in a reasonable time). MS Office XP files protected using CSP (Cryptographic Service Provider) are also supported.
